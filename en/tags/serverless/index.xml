&lt;p>AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service and after having worked with it for some time, I felt it is a good time for me to share my learning and experiences. I have been thinking of writing an article in a &amp;ldquo;Virtual Podcast format&amp;rdquo; and felt this could be the one.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Welcome all to this article named &lt;em>AWS Lambda - A Virtual Podcast&lt;/em> and let me introduce our guests Mr. Hernandez and Ms. Jessica who would walk us through their experiences of using AWS Lambda.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Concluding Serverless Journey</title><link>/en/blog/concluding_serverless_journey/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/concluding_serverless_journey/</guid><description>&lt;p>We have come a long way in our &lt;a href="/en/blog/beginning_serverless_journey">Serverless journey&lt;/a>
. This journey which started with building a serverless application has finally come to a stage where we can see all
our hard work in action. We will be deploying our application in this article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will be using &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS CDK&lt;/a>
 to deploy our application. Before we start using CDK, let&amp;rsquo;s quickly look at what is CDK -&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open source software development framework to model and provision your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages.
Provisioning cloud applications can be a challenging process that requires you to perform manual actions, write custom scripts, maintain templates, or learn domain-specific languages.
AWS CDK uses the familiarity and expressive power of programming languages for modeling your applications. It provides you with high-level components that preconfigure cloud resources with
proven defaults, so you can build cloud applications without needing to be an expert. AWS CDK provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner through AWS CloudFormation&lt;/strong>.
It also enables you to compose and share your own custom components that incorporate your organization&amp;rsquo;s requirements, helping you start new projects faster.

 which started with a web application that involved an AWS lambda, an API Gateway and DynamoDB.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had some unit tests for our controller, service and request objects. But, these tests don&amp;rsquo;t give us the kind of confidence we need to deploy our application. At this stage we don&amp;rsquo;t even know if the query that is written in the repository is going to work properly or not, forget about releasing the application.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beginning Serverless Journey</title><link>/en/blog/beginning_serverless_journey/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/beginning_serverless_journey/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Serverless is a paradigm that lays its foundations on the fact that &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t have to provision and manage servers&amp;rdquo;.
This article series explores various aspects involved in a serverless application lifecycle including - development, testing and deployment.
Our serverless journey which starts from building to deploying an application will be using multiple serverless components including AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, AWS DynamoDB, LocalStack and AWS CDK.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Let us deep dive step by step into what it takes to build a Serverless application.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
