I have been thinking of writing an article in a &amp;ldquo;Virtual Podcast format&amp;rdquo; and felt this could be the one.
Welcome all to this article named AWS Lambda - A Virtual Podcast and let me introduce our guests Mr.</description></item><item><title>Concluding Serverless Journey</title><link>/en/blog/concluding_serverless_journey/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/concluding_serverless_journey/</guid><description>We have come a long way in our Serverless journey . This journey which started with building a serverless application has finally come to a stage where we can see all our hard work in action. We will be deploying our application in this article.
We will be using AWS CDK to deploy our application. Before we start using CDK, let&amp;rsquo;s quickly look at what is CDK -
The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open source software development framework to model and provision your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages.</description></item><item><title>Testing Serverless Journey</title><link>/en/blog/testing_serverless_journey/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/testing_serverless_journey/</guid><description>It is time to test our Serverless journey which started with a web application that involved an AWS lambda, an API Gateway and DynamoDB.
We had some unit tests for our controller, service and request objects. But, these tests don&amp;rsquo;t give us the kind of confidence we need to deploy our application. At this stage we don&amp;rsquo;t even know if the query that is written in the repository is going to work properly or not, forget about releasing the application.</description></item><item><title>Beginning Serverless Journey</title><link>/en/blog/beginning_serverless_journey/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/beginning_serverless_journey/</guid><description>Serverless is a paradigm that lays its foundations on the fact that &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t have to provision and manage servers&amp;rdquo;. This article series explores various aspects involved in a serverless application lifecycle including - development, testing and deployment. Our serverless journey which starts from building to deploying an application will be using multiple serverless components including AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, AWS DynamoDB, LocalStack and AWS CDK.
Let us deep dive step by step into what it takes to build a Serverless application.</description></item></channel></rss>
