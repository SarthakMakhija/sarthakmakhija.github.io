We had some unit tests for our controller, service and request objects. But, these tests don&amp;rsquo;t give us the kind of confidence we need to deploy our application. At this stage we don&amp;rsquo;t even know if the query that is written in the repository is going to work properly or not, forget about releasing the application.</description></item></channel></rss>
