. This journey which started with building a serverless application has finally come to a stage where we can see all
our hard work in action. We will be deploying our application in this article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will be using &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS CDK&lt;/a>
 to deploy our application. Before we start using CDK, let&amp;rsquo;s quickly look at what is CDK -&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open source software development framework to model and provision your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages.
Provisioning cloud applications can be a challenging process that requires you to perform manual actions, write custom scripts, maintain templates, or learn domain-specific languages.
AWS CDK uses the familiarity and expressive power of programming languages for modeling your applications. It provides you with high-level components that preconfigure cloud resources with
proven defaults, so you can build cloud applications without needing to be an expert. AWS CDK provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner through AWS CloudFormation&lt;/strong>.
It also enables you to compose and share your own custom components that incorporate your organization&amp;rsquo;s requirements, helping you start new projects faster.
