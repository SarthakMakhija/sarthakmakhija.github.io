A bloom filter can query against large amounts of data and return either &amp;ldquo;possibly in the set&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;definitely not in the set&amp;rdquo;.
A bloom filter can have false positives, but false negatives are impossible.
Elements can only be added to the set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with the counting bloom filter variant).</description></item><item><title>Count-min sketch</title><link>/en/blog/count_min_sketch/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/count_min_sketch/</guid><description>Count-min sketch (CM sketch) is a probabilistic data structure1 used to estimate the frequency of events in a data stream.
It relies on hash functions to map events to frequencies, but unlike a hash table, it uses only sublinear space at the expense of over-counting some events due to hash collisions. The count–min sketch was invented in 2003 by Graham Cormode and S. Muthu Muthukrishnan.
Understanding Count-min Sketch Let&amp;rsquo;s say we want to build a solution to count the frequency of elements in a data stream.</description></item></channel></rss>
