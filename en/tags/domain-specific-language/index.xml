This is in contrast to a general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains. There are a wide variety of DSLs, ranging from widely used languages for common domains, such as HTML for web pages, down to languages used by only one or a few pieces of software.
Kotlin DSL Kotlin provides first class support for DSL which allows us to express domain-specific operations much more concisely than an equivalent piece of code in a general-purpose language.</description></item></channel></rss>
