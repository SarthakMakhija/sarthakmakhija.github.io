It is this bytecode which gets executed by JVM and is later converted into machine specific instructions by JIT compiler. With this article, we attempt to dive into bytecode and understand the internals of various bytecode operations.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get an understanding of some terms before we start to dive in.
Terminology Bytecode

However, there have been a number of languages developed on top of the JVM, like Kotlin Kotlin is a statically typed programming language for modern multi-platform applications. While I have been a Java developer for quite a long while, working on the data-anonymization project made me feel that there are things that Java should consider importing from Kotlin.</description></item></channel></rss>
