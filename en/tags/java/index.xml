 &lt;p>Java code is compiled into an intermediate representation called "bytecode". It is this bytecode which gets executed by JVM and is later converted into machine specific instructions by JIT compiler. With this article, we attempt to dive into bytecode and understand the internals of various bytecode operations.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s get an understanding of some terms before we start to dive in.&lt;/p>

However, there have been a number of languages developed on top of the JVM, like &lt;a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kotlin&lt;/a>
Kotlin is a statically typed programming language for modern multi-platform applications. While I have been a Java developer for quite a long while, working on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/dataanon/data-anon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">data-anonymization&lt;/a> project made me feel that there are things that Java should consider importing from Kotlin.
These are some Kotlin features that I would love to see making a place in Java.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
