Traditional serializable isolation, while guaranteeing data integrity, often suffers from performance bottlenecks due to extensive locking. This article explores Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI) that promises the best of both worlds: strong data consistency without sacrificing performance. The article delves into the inner workings of SSI and explore its implementation for a Key/Value storage engine. I will refer to the research paper titled A critique of snapshot isolation .</description></item><item><title>WiscKey: Separating Keys from Values in SSD-Conscious Storage</title><link>/en/blog/wisckey_ssd_conscious_key_value_store/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/wisckey_ssd_conscious_key_value_store/</guid><description>LSM-tree (Log structured merge tree) is a data structure typically used for write-heavy workloads. LSM-tree optimizes the write path by performing sequential writes to disk. WiscKey is a persistent LSM-tree-based key-value store that separates keys from values to minimize read and write amplification. The design of WiscKey is highly SSD optimized, leveraging both the device&amp;rsquo;s sequential and random performance characteristics.
This article summarises the WiscKey paper published in 2016.</description></item></channel></rss>
