Traditional serializable isolation, while guaranteeing data integrity, often suffers from performance bottlenecks due to extensive locking. This article explores Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI) that promises the best of both worlds: strong data consistency without sacrificing performance. The article delves into the inner workings of SSI and explore its implementation for a Key/Value storage engine. I will refer to the research paper titled A critique of snapshot isolation .</description></item><item><title>Diving into Rust by building an assertions crate</title><link>/en/blog/diving_into_rust/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/diving_into_rust/</guid><description>As Rust projects grow in size and complexity, the need for sophisticated error handling tools becomes ever more pressing. Traditional methods like panics and asserts, while useful, can be limited and cumbersome.
Let&amp;rsquo;s build an assertions crate that offers elegant and powerful assertions, while simultaneously diving into the diverse landscape of Rust features.
Introduction Let&amp;rsquo;s define some requirements for our crate. The assertions crate should:
Offer Fluent API: chain assertions for a natural and readable experience.</description></item><item><title>Designing an in-memory LFU cache</title><link>/en/blog/designing_lfu_cache/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/designing_lfu_cache/</guid><description>I had been working on building an in-memory LFU cache (least frequently used cache) and now that it is done, I thought of writing about the building blocks of an LFU cache. This article shares the building blocks of an LFU cache along with the ideas from two research papers: TinyLFU and BP-Wrapper CacheD is the name of my cache, and it is inspired by Ristretto . I know CacheD is a very creative name.</description></item><item><title>Bitcask - A Log-Structured Hash Table</title><link>/en/blog/bitcask/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/bitcask/</guid><description>Bitcask is an embeddable key/value storage engine that is defined as a &amp;ldquo;Log-Structured Hash Table&amp;rdquo; in the paper that introduced it. Bitcask follows a simple model: all the key/value pairs are written to append-only files, and an in-memory data structure contains a mapping between each key and the position of the value in the data file.
Let&amp;rsquo;s understand the different components of Bitcask.
Bitcask components Bitcask is a straightforward model to understand.</description></item><item><title>WiscKey: Separating Keys from Values in SSD-Conscious Storage</title><link>/en/blog/wisckey_ssd_conscious_key_value_store/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/wisckey_ssd_conscious_key_value_store/</guid><description>LSM-tree (Log structured merge tree) is a data structure typically used for write-heavy workloads. LSM-tree optimizes the write path by performing sequential writes to disk. WiscKey is a persistent LSM-tree-based key-value store that separates keys from values to minimize read and write amplification. The design of WiscKey is highly SSD optimized, leveraging both the device&amp;rsquo;s sequential and random performance characteristics.
This article summarises the WiscKey paper published in 2016.</description></item><item><title>Bloom filter</title><link>/en/blog/bloom_filter/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/bloom_filter/</guid><description>A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure1 used to test whether an element is a set member. A bloom filter can query against large amounts of data and return either &amp;ldquo;possibly in the set&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;definitely not in the set&amp;rdquo;.
A bloom filter can have false positives, but false negatives are impossible.
Elements can only be added to the set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with the counting bloom filter variant).</description></item><item><title>Code without automated tests?

The benefits of these tests are so compelling that it does not even make sense to think about writing code without tests or writing code today and adding tests later. Despite the benefits, we still see code without tests, we still see ideas like &amp;ldquo;writing code today and adding tests when the delivery pressure reduces&amp;rdquo; floating around.</description></item><item><title>Count-min sketch</title><link>/en/blog/count_min_sketch/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/count_min_sketch/</guid><description>Count-min sketch (CM sketch) is a probabilistic data structure1 used to estimate the frequency of events in a data stream.
It relies on hash functions to map events to frequencies, but unlike a hash table, it uses only sublinear space at the expense of over-counting some events due to hash collisions. The countâ€“min sketch was invented in 2003 by Graham Cormode and S. Muthu Muthukrishnan.
Understanding Count-min Sketch Let&amp;rsquo;s say we want to build a solution to count the frequency of elements in a data stream.</description></item><item><title>Persistent memory - Introduction</title><link>/en/blog/persistent_memory/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/persistent_memory/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Invoking C Code from Golang</title><link>/en/blog/invoking_c_from_go/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/invoking_c_from_go/</guid><description>The article attempts to explore Golang&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; package which allows invoking C code from Golang. Before we get into the idea of invoking C code from Golang, let&amp;rsquo;s see a use-case where this might be needed.
Interfacing with an existing C library Let&amp;rsquo;s consider that we wish to develop a storage engine for pmem (persistent memory) in Golang. In order to develop this, we might want to use pmdk - persistent memory development kit which is written in C.</description></item><item><title>Diving into Java Bytecode</title><link>/en/blog/diving_into_java_bytecode/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/diving_into_java_bytecode/</guid><description>Java code is compiled into an intermediate representation called "bytecode". It is this bytecode which gets executed by JVM and is later converted into machine specific instructions by JIT compiler. With this article, we attempt to dive into bytecode and understand the internals of various bytecode operations.

We had some unit tests for our controller, service and request objects. But, these tests don&amp;rsquo;t give us the kind of confidence we need to deploy our application. At this stage we don&amp;rsquo;t even know if the query that is written in the repository is going to work properly or not, forget about releasing the application.</description></item><item><title>Beginning Serverless Journey</title><link>/en/blog/beginning_serverless_journey/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/beginning_serverless_journey/</guid><description>Serverless is a paradigm that lays its foundations on the fact that &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t have to provision and manage servers&amp;rdquo;. This article series explores various aspects involved in a serverless application lifecycle including - development, testing and deployment. Our serverless journey which starts from building to deploying an application will be using multiple serverless components including AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, AWS DynamoDB, LocalStack and AWS CDK.

This is in contrast to a general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains. There are a wide variety of DSLs, ranging from widely used languages for common domains, such as HTML for web pages, down to languages used by only one or a few pieces of software.
Kotlin DSL Kotlin provides first class support for DSL which allows us to express domain-specific operations much more concisely than an equivalent piece of code in a general-purpose language.</description></item><item><title>Kotlin Wishlist for Java</title><link>/en/blog/kotlin_wishlist_for_java/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/kotlin_wishlist_for_java/</guid><description>There is no doubt that Java has enjoyed a superior position when it comes to programming languages and is considered as one of the most important languages for development. However, there have been a number of languages developed on top of the JVM, like Kotlin Kotlin is a statically typed programming language for modern multi-platform applications. While I have been a Java developer for quite a long while, working on the data-anonymization project made me feel that there are things that Java should consider importing from Kotlin.</description></item><item><title>Letâ€™s deal with Legacy code</title><link>/en/blog/lets_deal_with_legacy_code/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/blog/lets_deal_with_legacy_code/</guid><description>This article is in continuation with the previous article where we defined some key aspects of Legacy code. In this article we will learn to deal with Legacy code. Before we begin with an example, letâ€™s take a moment to understand Broken Window Theory.
